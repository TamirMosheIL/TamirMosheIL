# Hi there, I'm Tamir Moshe! 👋

I am an Algorithm Engineer with a B.Sc. degree in Physics, driven by genuine curiosity and a passion for solving challenging problems, particularly those with a mathematical foundation.
I enjoy exploring new fields of knowledge and have a proven ability to learn technical subjects independently.

My recent work and studies have expanded into AI development, including machine learning and deep learning. I have been exploring projects focused on regression, classification, and deep learning architectures, building practical experience alongside my background in algorithm design for autonomous systems.
